# Automatic Detection and Classification of Respiratory Diseases Using Deep Learning

![Project Banner](./assets/images/project-banner.png) <!-- Optional: Replace with a relevant image -->

## **Project Overview**

Respiratory diseases such as **COPD**, **pneumonia**, and **bronchiectasis** are leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to improve the diagnostic process for respiratory diseases by utilizing **deep learning** techniques to automatically detect and classify lung auscultation sounds. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the system is designed to aid healthcare professionals in making faster, more accurate diagnoses, reducing the potential for misdiagnoses and delays in treatment.

Our system processes lung sound data to identify key patterns and provides fast, accurate classification, helping to reduce misdiagnoses and delays in patient care.

### **Mission**
- **Improve Diagnostic Accuracy**: Leveraging AI to classify respiratory diseases accurately from lung sounds.
- **Faster Intervention**: Helping healthcare professionals detect respiratory conditions early.
- **Reduce Human Error**: Automating the diagnostic process to ensure consistent results and faster decisions.
